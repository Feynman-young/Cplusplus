# C++ Learning Repository

This repository is designed for learning the basics of C++ syntax, concurrency, and network programming.

- The **basic syntax** section is located in the `cpp` folder, which includes various programming syntax examples, STL (Standard Template Library) usage, and templates. The main code is derived from *C++ Templates: The Complete Guide (Second Edition)*.

- The **concurrency** code is found in the `conc` folder, aimed at learning multithreaded programming, with primary examples sourced from *C++ Concurrency in Action*.

- The **network programming** examples are in the `net` folder, dedicated to learning network programming, with code primarily taken from *Linux High-Performance Server Programming*.
